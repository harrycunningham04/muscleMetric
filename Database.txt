List of all database connections needed:

Function:
- Monday at midnight of the morning,
            checks each user to see if they have completed all workouts for that week, if yes add 1 to their weekly streak if no set streak to 0
            all completed workouts get set to not completed, 

Reading from database
- verify.tsx, the user management stage, use a token so user stays logged in for a day.

- Main.tsx, needs to connect to the workout exercises table, to get the list of exercises for the graphing ✅

- DashboardView.tsx, the facts table ✅

- plans.tsx, two different connections, plans table, linking to user id that is active, showing the default one as the big plan and the other plans below ✅
                                        workouts table, for the default plan the first workout that is not completes  ✅
                                        also the history calls  ✅

- history.tsx, getting all data from the history table, so each workout is labeled with each exercise completed with the number of sets done, then history details is with reps and weight for each set ✅

Can I combine these two and pass the data to workoutDetails when it is called, then in workout Details getting the info about each exercise when needed.

                                exercises table to get safety information about the exercises  ✅

- userProfile.tsx, user information, name age height weight etc ✅


Writing to database
- planEditor.tsx, creating a new workout, so needs to store title duration userId isDefault, ✅
                then workouts linking to this plan id creating each workout separately storing name and setting completed to 0 ✅
                workout exercises are stored with the sets reps and weight ✅
                goals stored so each exercise id and the weight they would like to reach with it is stored ✅
                starting weight placing the planId exerciseId with the users starting weight ✅
